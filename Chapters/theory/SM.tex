\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}\label{sec:sm}

The SM is formulated as a relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) where each particle in the theory is represented by its own field and excitations of those fields are then the physical particles that we observe in nature. Particles can interact with each other via the exchange of a subset of SM particles called \textit{force carriers}. The types of allowed interactions and their corresponding strengths are encoded in a Lagrangian density, \LSM, together with the particle properties (mass and spin).
