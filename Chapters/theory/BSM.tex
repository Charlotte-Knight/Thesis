\section{Theories Beyond the Standard Model}\label{sec:bsm}
Theories beyond the Standard Model (BSM) can be used to explain anomalous observations such as dark matter~\cite{Clowe:2006eq}, and to solve theoretical problems like the hierarchy problem~\cite{Thomson:2013zua}. In this section, three theories (or families of theories) relevant to the experimental work presented in this thesis are discussed: Warped Extra Dimensions (WED), the Next-to-Minimal-Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM), and Effective Field Theories (EFTs).
